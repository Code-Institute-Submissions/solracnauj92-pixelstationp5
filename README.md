# Project Struggles and Progress

This README outlines the challenges faced during the project's initial stages, the lessons learned, and the progress being made despite encountering obstacles.

## Personal Challenges and Impact on Learning

Before delving into the project challenges, it's important to note that a personal setback significantly affected my ability to balance full-time work and studies. A four-month illness last year disrupted my learning, necessitating a period of relearning and catching up. This context is essential for understanding the challenges faced during the project development.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Time Constraints:**
   - Working full-time presented challenges in allocating the expected hours to the project.
   - The initial timeline proved to be overly optimistic, resulting in a more time-consuming development process.

2. **React Project 'moments' Walkthrough:**
   - Benefited from a React project walkthrough to navigate through bugs and challenges encountered.
   - The walkthrough played a crucial role in problem resolution and enhancing overall project understanding.

3. **Originality vs. Pragmatism:**
   - Originally intended to create an entirely original project.
   - Practical challenges with the chosen stack led to a pivot towards leveraging existing resources and frameworks.

4. **Library Installations and Data Loss:**
   - Recurring challenge with unexpected loss of project data.
   - Required reinstalling all related libraries, causing time-consuming setbacks.
   - Disrupted the development flow for main projects and previous practice drafts.

5. **Workspace Timeout on Gitpod:**
   - Faced privacy issues, particularly the need to reconfigure settings after each workspace timeout.

## Current Progress 

In the face of challenges, there has been notable progress. Despite the elapsed time, my commitment to completing the project remains unwavering. Recognizing the possibility of an initial setback, I am determined to persist and embrace the opportunity for a project redo. While challenges were successfully navigated, acknowledging the time lost in the initial phases, I am steadfast in maintaining a positive mindset and forging ahead, as it is the only way forward at this point.

Additionally, I aim to include all pre-planning research below for easy reference until further progress is made. This comprehensive approach will ensure that all valuable insights and groundwork are readily available as I continue to drive the project forward.
